Project Overview
Create a full-stack web application with a Pomodoro/Focus Timer that includes background music during focus sessions. The app should work perfectly in both development and production environments.
Technical Stack

Frontend: React with TypeScript, Vite as build tool
Styling: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
Backend: Express.js with TypeScript
Audio: Background focus music that plays during timer sessions

Core Features Required
1. Timer Functionality

Circular visual timer display showing progress
Adjustable session length (1-60 minutes)
Start/Pause/Reset controls
Visual feedback showing remaining time (MM:SS format)
Status text showing current state ("Ready to focus", "Stay focused!", "Paused")
Notification when timer completes

2. Timer Controls

Increase/decrease session length buttons (only when timer is not active)
Large start/pause button with appropriate icons
Reset button to stop and reset timer
Draggable handle on circular timer to adjust minutes (when not active)

3. Audio Integration (CRITICAL for production)

Background music that plays during active focus sessions
Music should loop continuously during session
Music pauses when timer is paused
Music stops when timer is reset or completes

4. UI/UX Requirements

Clean, modern interface using cards
Smooth animations for timer progress
Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
Dark mode support
Proper hover states and visual feedback

CRITICAL Implementation Details for Audio to Work in Production
Audio File Handling
The audio MUST be implemented using one of these approaches:
Option 1 (Recommended): Import as ES Module
typescript// In your timer component
import focusMusic from '@/assets/focus-music.mp3';

// Then use it like this
const audio = new Audio(focusMusic);
Option 2: Public Directory Approach
- Place audio file in: client/public/audio/focus-music.mp3
- Reference it as: new Audio('/audio/focus-music.mp3')
Build Configuration
Ensure these configurations are correct:
vite.config.ts:

Proper alias setup for @ imports
Correct build output directory
Asset handling configured

package.json scripts:
json{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "NODE_ENV=development tsx server/index.ts",
    "build": "vite build",
    "start": "NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js"
  }
}
